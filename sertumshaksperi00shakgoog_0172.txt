COWPER.

, And now the turnpike gates again

Flew open in short space3

The toll-men thinking, ae before,

That Gilpin rode a race. ⁵

And so he did, and won it too,

For he got first to town;
’ Nor 'stopp'd till where he had got up
He did again get down.

Now let us sing, long live the king,
And Gilpin, long live hei

And, when he next doth ride abroad‚
May Ι be there to seei
