38 Two ennrnnnnn on vnnonn.

Who is Silvia? What is she,
That eil our swains commend her?
, Holy, sair, and wise is she3

The heavens such grace did lend her,
That she might ndmired be.

Is she kind as she is fair?

For Beauty lives with Kindness:
Love doth'to her eyes repair‚

To help him os his blindness;
And, being helped, inhabits there.

Then to Silvia letus sing,
That Silvia is excelling3

She excels each mortal thing
Upon the dull earth dwelling.

To her let us garlands bring.
