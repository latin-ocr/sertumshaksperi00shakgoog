Mourn not 0'er early graves, for those
Removed whilst only buds are shown;

For God, who sowed and watered, knows

The time to gather in his own.

This blossom knew no winter’s breath,

Sheltered beneath the Almighty wing3

· And though it selt the stroke os death,

Blest babe, it never felt the sting.
