GEORGE HERBERT.

Sweet Day, so cool, so calm, so bright,
The bridal of the earth and sky,

The dew shall weep thy fall to-night,

For thou must die.

Sweet Rose, whose hue, angry and breve, ‚

Bids the rash gazer wipe his eye,

Thy root is ever in the grave,

And thou must die.

Sweet Spring, full of sweet days and roses‚

A box where sweets compacted lie,

My music shews ye have your closeS‚

And all must die.

Only a sweet and virtuous Soul,

Like season’d timber, never gives3

But, though the whole world tum to coal, .

Then chiefly lives.
