130 oowpnn.

The morning came, the chaise was brought,
But yet was not allow'd

To drive up to the door, lest all
Should say that she was proud:

So three doors off the chaise was stay'd,
Where they did all get in;

Six precious souls, and all agog

To dash through thick and thin

Smack went the whip‚ round went the wheels,
Were never folk so glad!
The stones did rattle underneath,

As if Cheapside were mad.

John Gilpin at his horse's side
· Seized sast the flowing mane,
And up he got, in haste to ride,

But soon came down agaim
