· · OYMBELINE.

’ , Fear no more the heat 0' the sun,

Nor the furious winteffs rages;
Thou thy worldly task host¹ done,

Home art gone, and ta'en thy wages:

Ι Golden lads and girls all m'ust,

As chimney-sweepers, come to dust.

Fear no more the fronn o' the great3
Thou art, past the tyrant's suoke;
Care no more to clothe and eat3
To thee the reed is as the oak:
The sceptre, learning, physio, must

All follow this‚· and come to dust.
