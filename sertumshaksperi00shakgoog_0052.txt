36 TWELFTH mour.

But when I came unto my bed,
With hey ho! the wind and the rain!
With toss-pot still I had broken head,

For the rain it raineth every day.

A great while ago the world begnn,
With hey ho! the wind and the rain!
But that 's all one, our play is done,

And we 'll strive to pleaser you every day.
