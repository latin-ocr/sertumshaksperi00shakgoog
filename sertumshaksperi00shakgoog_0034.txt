The lunatio, the lover, and the poet
Are of imagination all compen:-
One sees more devils than vast hell ean hold;

That is the madman: the lover all as frantie

Sees Helen's beauty in a brow of Egypt:

The poet’s eye, in a fine frenzy rolling,

Doth glance from heaven to earth, from earth to 3
heaven,
And, as imagination bodies fonh
· The forms of things unknown, the poet's pen
Turns them to shepes, and gives to airy nothing

A'klocal habitation and a name.
