As master John walked out alone
All with his deur Mam,

He saw a bird, picked upa stone;
“Ha! ha!’' said she, “hal ha!’'

‘⁶ D’ye think I'd suffer you, odds bobbinl
Such wickedness to do?

Suppose you were a little robin‚
And I should fling at you

“’T1s a sad thing, and quite absurd‚
And crue} too, d’ye see,

To kill a little harmiess bird
That never did kill thee?

Repentant John threw down his sling,
And cried, while tears did burst,

“I never will kill any thing, ⁰
Except it kills me first?
