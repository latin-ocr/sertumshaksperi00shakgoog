unm.

Suam. By the rushy-fringedhank,
Where grows the πίθον, and the osier dank,

My sliding chariot stays, α
Thicksetwithagate,andtheazuresheen

Of turkis blue, and emerald green2
That in the channel strays3

Whilst from off the waters fleet

Thus 1 set my printless feet,

O'er the cowslip’s velvet head,
That bends not as I tread.

Gentle swain, at thy request,

1 am here.
