Their name, their years, spelt by the unletter’d Muse,
The place of fame and elegy supply ;
And many a holy text around she strews,

That teach the rustic moralist to die.

For who, to dumb forgetfuiness a prey,
This pleasing anxious being e’er resigned;
Leit the warni precincts of the cheerful day,

Nor cast one longing, ling'ring look behind?

On some fond breast the parting soul relies,

Some pious drops the closing eye requires,
E’en from the tomb the voice of nature eries,

E'en in our ashes live their wonted fires.

For thee, wh0‚ mindful of the unhonour'd dead,

Dost in these lines their artless tale relate,

Ii, chance, by lonely Contemplation led, ,
Some kindred spirit shall enquire thy fate:
