The calender, amazed to see
His neighbour in such tum,

Laid down his pipe, flew to the gato,
Ano thus accosted him:

What news? what news? your tidings tell;
Tell me you must and shall-
Say why bareheaded you are come,

Or why you come at all?

Now Gilpin had a pleasant wit,
And loved a timely joke3
And thus uuto the calender

In merry guise he spoke;

I came because your horse would come;

And, il 1 well forbode,
My hat and wig will soon be here,
They are upon the road.
