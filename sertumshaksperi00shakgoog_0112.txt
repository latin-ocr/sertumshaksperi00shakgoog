When she is by, I leave my work,

I love her so sincerely ; ·
My master comes, like any Turk,

And bangs me most severely;
But let him bang his belly full,

I'll bear it all for Sally;
She is the derling os my beart, '

And she lives in our alley.

Of all the days are in the week
I dearly love but one day3 ’

And that 's the day that comes betwixt
A Saturday and Monday3

For then I'm drest in all my best,
To walk abroad with Sally.

She is the darling of my beart,-

And she lives in our alley.
