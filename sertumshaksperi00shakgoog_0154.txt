COWPER

Away went Gilpin, neck or naught;

Away went hat and wig3

He little dreamt, when he set out,

Os running such a rig.

The wind did blow, the eloah did fly,
Like streamer long and gay, ι
Till, loop and button failing both,

At last it flew away.

Then might all people well discern.
The bottles he had slung:
A bottle swinging at each side,

As hath been said or sung.

The dogs did bark, the children scream'd‚
Up flew the windows all;

And every soul cried out, Well done!
As loud as he could bawl.
