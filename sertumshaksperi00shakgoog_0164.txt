The calender, right glad to find
His friend in merry pin,
Return'd him not a single word,

But to the house wentin3

Whence straight he came with hat and wig,
Α wig that flow’d behind,

A hat not much the worse for wear,

Each comely in its kind.

He held them up, andin histum
Thus show’d his ready wit- ,
My head is twice as big as yours,

It therefore needs must fit.

But let me serape the dirt away
That hange upon your face;
And stop and eat, for well you may

Be in a hungry case.
