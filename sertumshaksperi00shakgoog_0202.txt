186 noonn.

Oh, weep sor the hour, when to Eveleen's hower

The lord os the valley with false vows came;
The moon hid her light from the heavens that night,
And wept behind the clouds o’er the maiden's shame.

The clouds pass'd soon from the chaste cold moon,
And heaven smiled again with her vestal flame,
But nonewill see the daywhen the clouds shall pass away,

Which that dark hour left upon Eveleen's fame.

The white show lay on the narrow pathway‚

When the lord of the valley crost over the moor;
And ma'ny a deep print on the white snow's tint

Show’d the track of his footstep to Eveleen’s door.

The next sun’s ray soon melted away
Every trace on the path where the false lord came;
But there ’s a light above, which alone can remove

That stain upon the snow of fair Eveleen’s fame.
