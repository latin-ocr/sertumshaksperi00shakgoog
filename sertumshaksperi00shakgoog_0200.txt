184 worn.

We thought, as we hollow’d his narrow bed,
And smooth'd down his loneiy pillow,

That the foe and the stranger would tread 0'er his head,

And we far away on the billow3

Lightly they 'll talk of the spirit that's gone,

And o'er his cold ashes upbraid him;

But little he ’ll rech, if they let him sleep on

In the grave where his Britons have laid him.

But half of our heavy tasi< was done,
When the cloch toll'd the hour ior retiring;
And we heard the distant and random gun
That the see was suilenly firing.

Slowly and sadly we laid him down,
From the field of his same fresh and gory3

We carved not a line, we raised not a stone,

But we left him aione with his ¹glory.
