That each may find its most 'propitious light,
And shine by situation hardly less

Than by the labour and the shill it eost,-
Are occupations os the poet's mind,

So pleasing, and that steal away the thought

With such address from themes os sad'import,

That, lost in his own musings, happy man!
He seels the anxieties of life, denied
Their wonted entertainment, all rethe.

Such joys has he that sings.
Taskâ€š II. 285.
