BEN ymon,

The Figure that thou here seest put,

It was for gentle Shakspeare cut3
Wherein 'the graver had a strife

With nature to outdo the life.

O could he but have drawn his wit

As well in brass, as he hath hit

His face3 the print would then surpass
, All that was ever writ in brass:

But, since he cannot, reader, look

No't on his picture, but his book.

Under Shdtspenre's pomit, prefixed to his worlu,1623.
