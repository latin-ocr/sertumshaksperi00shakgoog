ΡΑ SSIONA ΤΕ

Crabbed age and youth
Cannot live together: ⁹

Youth is full of pleasure,
Age is lull of care;

Youth like summer morn,
Age like winter weather;

Youth like summer brave,

⁴ Age like winter bare.

Age, I do abhor thee;

Youth, I do adore thee,·

Ο my Love, my Love is young.
Age, 1 do dely thee,
*Ol sweet shepherd hie thee!

For, methinks‚ thou stayest too long. ’
