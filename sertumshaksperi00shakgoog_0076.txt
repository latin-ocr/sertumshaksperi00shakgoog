Second wilch.
⁴ Fillet of a senny snake,

In the cauldron boil and bake3
Eye of newt, and toe of frog,

ζ Wool of bat, and tongue of dog,
Adder's fork, and blind-worm’s sting‚

Lizard's leg, and owlet’s wing,

For a clfarm of powerful trouble,

Like a hell-broth boil and bubble.

All.
Double‚ double toil and trouble, ,

Fire burn; and cauldron bubblei

Third wilch.
Scale of dagon, tooth of wolf,

Witches mummy; maw and guff
Of 'the ravin’d salt-sea shark;
Root of hemlock digged i’ the dark3
