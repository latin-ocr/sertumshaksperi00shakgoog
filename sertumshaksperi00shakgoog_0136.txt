Water, parted from the sea,

May ¹increase the river’s tide,

To the bubbling fou‘nt may fiee, “

Or through fertile valleys glide ; '''; ’

Though‚ in search os lost repose‚
Through the earth ’tis free to roam;
still it murmurs as it flows‚

Panting for its native home.

From Memmio, ⁸¹ L'onda da'l mar divin,” Am. iii. 1.
