“ The next, with dirges due, in sad army,
“ Slow thro’ the ehurch-way path we saw him borne,-
“ Approach and read (for thou canst read) the lay
“ Graved on the stone, heneath yon aged thorn.’'

Χ Here rests his head upon the 121') of earth

A youth to Fortune and to Fame unknowm
Fair Seience frowned not on hh humble birth,
And Melancholy marked him for her own.

Large was his bounty‚ and his soul‘sincern
Heaven did a reeompense as hrgely send;
He gave to Misery all he had, a ταῖς

He gain'ed from heaven, 'ms all he wished, a friend.

No further seek his merits to disclose,
Or draw his frailties from their (head abode3

(There they alike in trembling hope repose)
The bosom of his Father and his God.
