But Knowledge to their eyes her ample page,
Rich with the spoils of time, did ne’er unfold;
Chill Penury repressed their noble roge,

Andiroze the genial current of the soul.

Full many. a gem of purest ray serene
The dark unfathom'd caves of ocean bear,
Full many a flower is born to blush unseen,

And waste its sweetness on the desert air.

’ Some village Hampden, who with dauntless hreast
The little tyrant os his fields withstood3
Some mute inglorious Milton here may rest,

Some Cromwell, guiltless of his country’s blood.

The applause of listening senates to command,
The threats of pain and ruin to despise,
To scatter plenty o'er ‘a smiling land,

And read their hist’ry in a nation’s eyes,
