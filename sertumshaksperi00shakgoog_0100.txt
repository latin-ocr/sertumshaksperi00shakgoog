Sabn'na fair,
Listen where thou art sitting
Under the glassy, eool, translucent wave, ’
In twisted braids of lilies knitting
The loose train os thy amber-dropping hair:
Listen for dear honour's sake,
Goddess os the silver lake,
Listen and save.
Listen and appear to us
In name of great Oceanus;
By the eatth-shaking Neptune’s mace,
And Tethy’s grave, majestie paee,
By hoary Nereus’ wrinkled look,
And the Catpathian wizard's hook, ,

By sealy Triton’s winding shell,

And old sooth-seying Glaucus’ spell,
By Leucothea's lovely hands,
And her son that rules the strands,
