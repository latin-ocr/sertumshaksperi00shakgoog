The twentieth year is well nigh past,

Since first our sky was overbast;—

Ah, would that this might be the last,
My Mary.

Thy spirits have a fainter flow,
1 see thee daily weaker grow;-
'Twas my distress that brought thee low,

My Mary.

Thy memes, once a shining stote,

For my sake restless heretofore,

Now rust disused‚ and shine no more,

My Mary.
