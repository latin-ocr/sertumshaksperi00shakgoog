“ Again‚ would your lordship a moment suppose,

(’Tis a case that has happen’d and may be again)

That the visage or countenance had not a Nose,

Pray‚ who would or who could wear spectacles then?

“On the whole it appears, and my argument shows,

With a reasoning the court will never condemn,

That the spectacles plainly were made lor the Nose,

And the Nose was as plainly intended lor them.''

Then shil'ting his side, as a lawyer knows how,
He pleaded again in behall of the Eyes;
But what were his arguments few people know,-

For the court did not think they were equally wise.

So his lordship decreed‚ with a grave solemn tone,
Decisive and clear, without one is or but,-

That whenever the Nose put his spectacles on·-
By daylight or candlelight-Eyes should be shut.
