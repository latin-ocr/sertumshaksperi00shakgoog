Little Tom had a best ooat, a smart Sundny waistcoat,
And neat pair of black Spanish pumps;
His mother she told him, how greatly she 'd scold him,

If into the hennei he jumps.

'Twas morning on Sunday, and surely ior one day
A boy might give over his pranks3

But he went off to chapel, devouring an appie,

For which he gave grandpapa thanks.

He carne to the hennei, covered 0'er with green fennel,
The waters were running a flood,

Says he, “I’ll jump over it; none at horne will dis·

When flop he fell into the mud. cover it‚”

His mother, she thumpt him; and Hannvh, she pumpt
He nearly carne in for the birch; him’
Stripped of his Sunday clothes, dressed in his Monday

Sent crying to asternoon-church. Clothffl'
