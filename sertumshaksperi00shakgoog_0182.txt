Between Nose and Eyes a strange contest arose,
The spectacles set them unhappily wrong3
The point in dispute was, as all the world knows,

To which the said spectacles ought to belong.

So the Tongue was the lawyer, and argued the cause,
With a great deal ol shill, and a wig lull of learning;
While Chiel Baron Ear sat to balance the lawS,

So lamed lor his talent in nicely discerning.

“ In behals ol the Nose it will quickly appear,

And your lordship,” he sau, “will undoubtedly find, '

That the Nose has had spectacles always in wear,

Which amounts to possession time out of mind.''

Then,—holding the spectacles up to the court,—
“Your lordship observes they are made with a straddle,
As wide as the ridgc os the Nose is, in short,

Design’d to sit close to it, just like a saddle.
