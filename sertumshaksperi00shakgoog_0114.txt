CAREY.

My master carries me to church,

ι And osten 1 am blamed,

Becauae Ι leave him in the lurch,
As soon as text is named.

I leave the church in sermon time
And shnk away to Sally3

She is the darling of my heart,

And she lives in our alley.

When Christmas comes about again,
01 then 1 shall have money ς

I’ll hoard it up andhox and all,
I'll give it to my honey.

I would it were ten thousand pound,
I'd give lt all to Sally3

She is the darling os my heart,

And she lives in out alley.
