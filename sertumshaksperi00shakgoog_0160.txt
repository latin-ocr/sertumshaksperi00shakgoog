GOWPER.

Stop‚ stop, John Gilpinl—here's the house—
They all aloud did cry ; Α
The dinner waitS, and we are tired:

Said Gilpin-so am l!

But yet his horse was not a whit
Inclined to tarry there ;
For why i—his owner had a house

Fuli ten miles off, at Ware.

'So like an arrow swift he flew
Shot by an¹ archer strong3

So he did fly-which brings me to
The middle of my song.

Away went Gilpin, out of breath,
And sore against his will,
Till at his friend the celender's

His horse at last stood still.
