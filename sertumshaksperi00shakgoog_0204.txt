BARBA ULD.

Lise, we ’ve been long together,
Through pleasant and through cloudy weather;

'Tis hard to part, when friends are dear,

Perhaps 'twill eost both pang and tear.

So steal away with little warning;
Choose thine own time, .
Say not “good night,” but in yon happier clime

Bid me good morning.
