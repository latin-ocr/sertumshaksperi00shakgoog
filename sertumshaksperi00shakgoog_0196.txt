180 cesaraeae.

But reddet yet theirfires shall gloy
On Linden's height of erimson’d show,

And bloodier still the torrent llow ·
Ol Iser‚ rolling rapidly.

The comhat deeperrs;-on, ye brave,

Who rush to glory or the grave!

Wave, Munich‚ all thy banners wave,

And charge with all thy ehivalryl

'Tis morin—but scarce yon level sun,
Can pierce the war-clouds, rollinghun,
Where furious Frank and fiery Hun

Shout in their sulphureus canopy.

Few‚ few shall part, where many meet,

The snow shall be their windingsheet‚
Ι And every sod beneath their leet
,Shyll be a soldier's sepulchre.
