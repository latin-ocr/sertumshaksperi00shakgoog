54 MERGHANT OF VENICE.

How sweet the moonlight sleeps 'upon this bank!
Here will we sit, and let the sounds of music
Creep in our ears: soft stillness and the night
Become the touches of sweet harmony.

Sit Jessica3-look‚ how the floor of heaven

Is thick inlaid with patines of bright gold;

There 's not the smallesss orb that thou behold'st,

But in his motion like an Angel singS,
Still quiring 'to the young-eyed Cherubims.
Such harmony is in immortal souls;

But, while this muddy vesture of decay

Doth grossly close it in, we cannot hear it.
