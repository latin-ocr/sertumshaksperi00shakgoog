camum.

On Linden, when the sun was low, Α
All bloodless lay the untrodden snows

And dark as winter was the flow

Os Iser‚ roll'mg rapidly.

But Linden show’d another sight,

When the drum beat at dead of night,
Commanding fires of death to light

The darkness of her scenery.

By torch and trumpet fast arrajd
Each horseman drew his battle-blade,
And furious every charger neigh'd,

To join the dreadsul revehy.

Then shook the hills by thunder riven,

Then flew the steed to battle driven,

And rolling like the bolts of heaven,
Far flash’d the red artillery.
