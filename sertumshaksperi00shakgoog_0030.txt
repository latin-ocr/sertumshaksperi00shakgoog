14 MIDSUMMER NIKGHT’S DREAM.

You spotted snakes, with double tongue,
Thomy hedge-hogs be not seen;
Newts and blind wonns, do no wrong,

' Come not near our fairy queen!

Philomel‚ with melody
Sing in our sweet lullaby‚

Lulla, lulla, lullaby‚ lulla, lulla, lullaby‚
Never harm, nor spelL nor cham,

Come our lovely lady nigh,

·So goqd night, with lullaby‚
