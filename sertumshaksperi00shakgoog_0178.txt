COWPER '

For could I view nor them nor thee,
What sight worth seeing could 1 see?
The sun would rise in vain sor me,

My Mary.

Partakers os thy sad decline,
Thy hands their little force resign,

Yet gently pr'est, press gently mine,

My Mary.

Such feebleness of limbs thou provest,

That now at every step thou movest

Upheld by twoÍ¾ yet still thou lovest,
My Mary.

And still to love, though prest with ill,
In wintry age to feel no chin,
With me is to be lovely still,

My Mary.
