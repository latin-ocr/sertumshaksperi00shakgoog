104

The breezy call oi incense-breathing mom,
The swallow twitten'ng from the straw-buiit shed,

The coek's shrili clarion‚ or the eehoing horn,

No mor‘e shall rouse them from their lowiy bed.

For them no more the blazing hearth shall burn„
Or busy housewise ply her evening care3
No chridren nm to lisp their sire’s return,

Or elimb his knees the envied kiss to share.

Ost did the harvest to their sickle yield‚
Their furrow oft the stubbom glebe has broke ;
How jocund did they drive their team afield!

How bowed the woods beneath their sturdy stroke!

Let not Ambition mock their usesui toil,

Their homely joys‚ and destiny obscure,
Nor Grandeur hear, with a disdainfui smile,

The short and simple annals of the poor.
