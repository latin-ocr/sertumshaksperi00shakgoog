GOWPER.

But not performing what he meant,
And gladly would have done,

The srighted steed he frighted more,
And made him faster run.

Away went Gilpin, and away
Went postboy at his heels,

The postboy’s horse right glad to miss
The lumbering of the wheels.

Six gentlemen upon the road,

Thus seeing Gilpin fly,
With postboy scampering in the rear,

They raised the hue and cry :-

Stop thief 1 stop thiefl—a highwayman!
Not one of them was mute;
And all and each that pass'd that way

Did j0in in the pursuit.
