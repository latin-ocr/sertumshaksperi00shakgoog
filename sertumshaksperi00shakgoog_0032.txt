Weaving spiderS, come not here,
Hence you long-legg’d spinners‚ hence3
Beetles black‚ approach not near3

Worm nor snail, do no offence.

Philomel, with melody‚

Sing infour sweet lullaby,

Luna, luna, lullaby,

Never harm, nor spell, nor charm,

Come our lovely lady nigh,

So good night, with lullaby.
