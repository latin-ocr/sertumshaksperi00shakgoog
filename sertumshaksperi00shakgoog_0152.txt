COWPER.

But finding soon a smoother road
Beneath his well-shod feet,

The snorting beast began to not, Ἰ
Which gall'd him in his seat.

So, Fair and softly, John he cried‚
But John he cried in vain;
That trot became a gallop soon,

In spite of curb and rein.

So stooping down, as needs he must
Who cannot sit uprjght,

He grasp'd the mane with both his hands,
And eke with all his might.

His horse, who never in that sort

Had handled been before,

What thing upon his back had got*

Did wonder more and more.
