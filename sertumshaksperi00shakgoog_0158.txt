COWPER.

But still he seemed to carry weight‚
With leathem girdle braced;
For ull might see the bottle necks

Still dangling at his waist.

Thus all through merry Islington
These gambols he did play,

Until he cameunto the Wash

Of Edmonton so gay3

And there he threw the wash about
On both sides of the way,

Just like unto a trunhling mop,

Or a wild goose at play.

At Edmonton his loving wife
From the balcony spied
Her tendet husband, wondering much

To see how he did ride.
