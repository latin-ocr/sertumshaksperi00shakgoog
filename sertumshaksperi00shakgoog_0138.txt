There is a pleasure in poetic paim,

Which only poets know. The shifts and tumS,

The expedients‚ and inventions multisorm

To which the mind morte, in search of termS,
Though apt, yet coy‚ and difficult to win,-
To arrest the fleeting images that fill

The mirror of the mind, and hold them fast,
And force them sit, till he has pencil'd off

A faithful likeness of the form he views ;-

Then to dispose his copies with such art
