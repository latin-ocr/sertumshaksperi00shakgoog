GOWPER.

He soon replied‚ I do admire
Os womankind but one,

⁴ ι And you are she, my dearest dear,

Therefore it shall be done.

Ι am a linendraper bold,
As all the world doth know,¹

J And my good friend the calender

Will lend his horse to go. ’

Quoth Mrs. Gilpin, That's well said;
And, sor that wine is dear‚

We will be fumished with our own,

Which is both bright and clear.

John Gilpin kiss'd his loving wife3
O'erjoy’d was he to find,

That, though on pleasure she was heht,
She had a hugal mind.
