’ COWPER.

For saddle=tree scarce reach'd had he,
His journey to begin,
When, turning round his head, he saw

Three customers come in. ·

So down he eame3 for loss of time,

Although it grieved him sore,

Yet loss os peuce, full well he knew,

Would trouble him much more.

’Twas long before the customers
Were suited to their mind,

When Betty‚ screaming‚ carne down stain,

The wine is left behind!

‚ Good lach! quoth he—yet bring it me,

My leathern belt likewise‚
’ In which I bear my trusty sword‚ ⁸

When Ι do exercise.
