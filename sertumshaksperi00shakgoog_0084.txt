HENRV VIII.

Orpheus with his lute made trees,
And the mountain-tops that freere,
Bow themselves, when he did sing;
To his music plants and flowers ·
Ever sprung3 as sun and showers,

There had been a lasting spring.

Every thing that heard him play,
E'en the billows os the sea,
Hung their heads, and then lay by.

In sweet music is such art,

Killing care and grief of heart,

Fall asleep, or hearing die! ⁵
