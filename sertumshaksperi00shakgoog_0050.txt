When that 1 was a little tiny boy,
With hey ho! the wind and the rain!

A ioolish thing was but a toy,

For the rain it raineth every day.

But when 1 came to man's estate,
With hey hoi the wind and the rain!
'Gainst knave and thies men shut their gete,

For the rain it raineth every day.

But when I came at last to wive‚

With hey hoi the wind and the rain 1⁴

By swaggering I could never thrive,

For the rain it raineth every day.
