BEN JoNsoN.

Would’st thou hear, what man can say
In a little? Reader‚ stay.

Underneath this stone doth lie

As much beauty, as could die;

Which, in life, did harbour give

To more virtue than doth live.

If at all she had a fault,

Leave it buried in this vault.

One name was Elizabeth3

The other,-let it sleep with Death.

Fitter where it died to tell,

Thhn that it lived at alh—Farewell.
