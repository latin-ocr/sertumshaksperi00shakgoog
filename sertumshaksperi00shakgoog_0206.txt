190 - ΑΝοΝνΜουε.

Though the rose on her cheek disappear end decay,
Can time with the rose steal the dimple away?
Age may alter her form, but must leave me behind

Her temper, hermanum, her beart, and het mind.

’ Roll on then, ye summers;-n0 change shall 1 see,

But Maria will stin be Maria to me.
