48 As ron rrrrr rr.

Blow, blow, thou winter wind,
Thou art not so unkind·
As man’s ingratitude:
Thy tooth is not so keen,
Because thou art not seen,
Although thy breath be rude.
Heigh ho! sing heigh hoi unto the green holly:

Most friendship is seigning, most loving mere folly.

Freeze, freeze‚ thou bitter sky,

Thou dost not bite so nigh

· As benefits forgot:
Though thon the waters warp,
Thy sting is not so sharp
As friend remembered not.
Heigh ho! sing heigh hol unto the green holly:
Most friendship is feigning, most loving mere folly.

Then, heigh ho, the holly!
This lise is most jolly.
