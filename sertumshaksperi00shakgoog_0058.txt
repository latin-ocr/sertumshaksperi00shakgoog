42 LOVE'S LABOURS LOST.

When daisies pied, and violets blue,
And lady-smocks all silver white,
And cuek00·buds of yellow hue,
Do paint the meadows with delight:
Τὴο Cuckoo then, on ever} nee,
Mocks married men, for thus sings he,

Cuckoo‚

Cuckoo, Cuckoo;-O word os sear,

Unpleasing to a married earl

When shepherds pipe on oaten stravn,
And merry larks are ploughmen’s clocks,
When turtles head, and rooks, and daws,
And maidens bleach their summer smocks3
The Cuckoo then, on every tree,
Mocks married men, sor thus sings he,

Cuckoo‚

Cuckoo, Cuckoo ;-0 word os sear,

Unpleasing to a married ear!
