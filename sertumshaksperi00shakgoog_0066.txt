50 MUOH Auo ABOUT NOTHING.

Sigh no more, ladies, sigh no more,
Men were deceivers ever;
One foot iu sea, audone on shore ;
To one thing constant never:
Then sigh not'so,
But let them ge,

And be you blithe and bonny;

Converting all your sounds os woe

Into Hey nonny, nonny. Ι

Sing no more ditties, sing no mo
¹ Os dumps so dull and heavy;
The fraud of men was everso,
Since summer first was leaf .
Then sigh not so,
But let them go,
And be you blithe and bonny,

'Converting all your sounds of woe

Into Hey nonny, nonny.
