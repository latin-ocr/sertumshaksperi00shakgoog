Sweet Eeho! sweetest nymph, that liv’st unseen

Within thy airy shell,
By slow Meander's margent green,
And in the violet-embroidered vale,
Where the love-lom nightingale
Nightly to thee her sad song mourneth well ς
Canst thou not tell me of a gentle pair,
That likest thy Narcissus are?
Oh! if thou have
Hid them in some flowery cave,
Tell me but where,
Sweet queen of parley, daughter of the sphere;
So may'st thou be translated to the aldes,
And give resounding grace to all Heaven's
