“ Oft have we seen him, at the peep ol dawn,

“ Brushing with hasty steps the dew away,

“To meet the sun upon the upland lawn.

“ There, at the foot of yonder nodding beech‚ ’

“And pore upon the brool that babbles by.

“ Herd by yon wood, now smiling as in scom,
“ Muttering his wayward fancies, he would rove,
“Now drooping‚ woelul wan, like one forlom,

“Or crazed with care, or crossed in hopeless love.
