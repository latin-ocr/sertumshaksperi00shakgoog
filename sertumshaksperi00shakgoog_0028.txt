12 MIDSUMMER melivs DREAM.

Over hill, over dale,
⁶ Thorough burh, thorough briar,
Over park, over pale,

Thorough flood, thorough lire,

I do wander everywhere

Swister than the moones sphere;
“ And I serve the fairy'queen,

To dew her orbs upon the green.

- The eowslips tall her pensioners be:
In their gold coats spots you see;
Those be rubies, fairy favours,

v In those freclrles live their savours;
I must go seek some dew-drops here,

And hang a pearl in every cowslip's eas.
