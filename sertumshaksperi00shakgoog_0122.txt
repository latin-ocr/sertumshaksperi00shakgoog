The boast of heraldry, the pomp of power, ¹
And all that beauty, all that wealth e’er gave,

Aah athe the inevitable hour;

The paths of glory lead but to the grave. -

Nor you, ye proud, inipute to these the fault,
If Memory o’er their tomb no trophies mise,

Where through the long-drawn aisle and fretted' vault

The pealing anthem swells the note of praise.

' Can storied um, or animated bust
Back to its mansion call the fleeting' breathi
Can Honour’s voice provoke the silent dust,

οι 'Flattery soothe the dun coh ear of Death?

Perhaps in this neglected spot is laid
Some heart once pregnant with celestia} fire3

Hands, that the rod of empire might have swayed,
Or waked to ecstasy the living lyre.
