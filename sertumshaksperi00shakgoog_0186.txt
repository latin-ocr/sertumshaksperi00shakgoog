The Spirit breathes upon the Word‚
And brings the truth to sight,

Precepts and promises afford

A sanctifying light.

A glory gilds the sacred page,
Majestic like the sun,

It gives a light to ev’ry age3

It gives, but borrovs none.

The Hand that gave it still supplies
The gracious light and heat3
His truths upon the nations rise;

They vise, but never set.
