01 mistress mine, where are you roaming?

O stay and hear: your true love 's coming,
That ean sing both high and low;

Trip no further, pretty sweeting ;

Journeys end in lovers' meeting‚

Every wise man's son doth know.

What is love? 'tis not hereafte13

Present mirth hath present laughter3
What 's to come is still unsure.

In delay there lies no plenty;

Then come kiss me, sweet and twenty,

’ Youth's a stuff will not endure.
