Their lot forbade; nor circumscribed alone
Their growing virtues, but their crimes confined3

Forbade to wade through slaughter to a throne,

And shut the gates oi mercy on mankind; Ι

The struggling pangs of conscious truth to hide,
To quench the blushes oi ingenuous shame‚
Or heap the shrine of Luxury and Pride

With incense kindled at the Muse’s flame.

Far from the madding crowd’s ignoble strife
Their sober wishes never learned to stray3

Along the cool, sequestered vale of lif ’

They kept the noiseless tenor of their way.

Yet, e'en these bones from insult to protect, -

Some frail memorial still erected nigh,
With uncouth rhymes, and shapeless sculpture deckt,

Implores the passing tribute of a sigh.
