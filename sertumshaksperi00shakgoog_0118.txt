The curfew tolls the knell of parting day,

. The lowing herd winde slowly o'er the lea,

The ploughman homeward plods his weary wal,

And leaves the world to darkness and to me. ‚

Now fades the glimmering landscape on the sight,
And all the air a solemn stillness holda

Save where the beetle wheels his droning ssight,
And drowsy tinklings lull the distant folds ;

Save that, from yonder ivy·mantled tower
The moping owl does to the moon complain
Of such as, wandering near her secret bower,

Molest her ancient solitary reign.

Beneath those rugged elmS, that yew·tree’s shade,
Where heaves the turf in many a mouldering heap,
Eaeh in his narrow cell lor ever laid

The rude forefathers of the hamlet sleep.
