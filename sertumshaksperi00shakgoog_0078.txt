Liver of blaspheming Jew,
. Gall of goat, and slips os yew
Slivered in the moon’s eclipse;

Nose of Turk, and Tartar’s lips ;

Finger of birth-stringled babe,

Ditch-delivered by a drab,
Make the gruel thick and slab; ’
Add thereto a tiger’s chaudron,

For the ingredients os our cauldron.

All.
Double‚ double toil and trouble,

Fire burm and cauldron bubblel
Se'cond witch.

Cool it with a baboon's blood,

Then the charm is firm and good.
