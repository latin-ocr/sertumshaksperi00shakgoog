By the simplicity os Venus' doves,
By that which knitteth souls and prospers loves;
In that same place thou hast appointed me,

λ To·morrow truly will Ι meet with thee.

By all the vows that ever men have broke,

In number more than ever women spokd ;

In that same place thou hast appointed me,

To·morrow truly will I meet with thee.
