camme ·

For, though thou gladly wouldst iulfii

The same kind office forme stili,

Thy sight now seconds not thy wiii,
My May· 0

But well thou play’dst the housewife’s part,
And all thy threads with magio art

Have wound themselves about this heart,

My Mary.

Thy indistinct expressions⁸ seem
Like language utter’d in a dream;
Yet me they charm, whate'er the theme,

My Mary.

Thy silver looks, once aubum bright·
Ate still more lovely in my sight
Than golden beams oi orient light,

My Mary.
