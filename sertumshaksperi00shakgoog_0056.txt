40 LOVE’S LABOURS LOST.

A merrier man,
Within the limit of becoming mirth‚
Ι never spent an hour's talk withah

His eye begets occasion sor his wit,·

For every object that the one doth catch,
The other turns to a mirth-moving jest;

Which his fair tongue, conceit's expositor,

Delivers in such apt and graeious wordS,

That aged ears play truant at'his tales,
And younger hearings are quite ravished3

So sweet and voluble is his discourse. ,
