44 LOVE'S LABOURS LOST. '

When icicles hang by the wall,

And Dici( the shepherd blows his nail,
And Tom bears logs into ¹the hall,
And milk comes frozen home in pail;
When blood is nipped, and ways be foul,
Then nightly sings the staring owl‚

To-who;

Tu·whit‚ to-wh0‚-a merry note,

While greasy Joan doth keel the pot.

When all axound the wind doth blnw,

And coughing drowns the parson's saw,

And birds sit brooding in the snow,

And Marian's nose looks red and raw3

When roasted crabs hiss in the bowl, ’
. Then nightly sings the stan'ng owl‚
To·wh0;
Tu·whit‚ to-wh0,-a merry note,

While greasy Joan doth keel the pot.
