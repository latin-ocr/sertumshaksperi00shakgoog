By Thetis' tinsel-slippered feet,

And the songs of Syrens sweet‚

By dead Parthenope’s dear tomb,
And fair Ligea's golden comb,
Wherewith she sits on diamond rocks

Sleeking her soft alluring lochs,

By all the nymphs that nightly dance

Upon thy streams with wily glauce,
Rise, rise, and heave thy rosy head
From thy coral-paven bed;

And bridle in thy headlong wave

Till thou our summons answered have.

Listen and save.
