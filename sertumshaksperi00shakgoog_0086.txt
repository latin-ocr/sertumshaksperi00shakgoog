soum·

Oh! howmuchmoredothssmmyboeuteousseem
By that παι ornament which Truth doth give!
The rose looks fair, but fairer it we deem

For that sweet odour which doth in it live.

The cenkerhlooms have full as deep a dye‚

Ae the persumed tincture of the rosen

Heng on euch thorus, and play as wantonly,

When Summeffe breath their masked buds discloses.
But, sor their virtue only is their show,

They live unwooed, and unrespected fade,

hie to themselves 3-sweet roses do not so;

Of their sweet deaths ere sweetest odours made.
And so os you, beauteous and lovely youth,

When that shall sade, my verse distils your truth.
