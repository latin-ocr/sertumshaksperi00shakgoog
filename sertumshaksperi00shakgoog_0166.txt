COWPER.

Said John, It is my weddingday,
And all the world would stare,

If wife should dine at Edm0nton‚
And I should dine at Ware.

So turning to his horse he said,
Ι am in haste to dine;
’Twas sor your pleasure you came here,

You shall go back for mine.

Ah, luckless speech, and bootless boastl
For which he paid full dem

For, while he spoke, a braying ass

Did sing most loud and clear3

Whereat his horse did snort, as he
Had heard a lion mar,

And gallop'd off with all his might,
As he had done before.
