Come away, come away, Denth,
And in sad cypress let me be laid ,·
, Fly away, fly away, breath,
1 am slain by a sair cruel maid.

My shroud os white, stuek all with yew,
Ο prepare itl

My part of death, no one so true
Did share ia

Not a flower, not a flower sweet
On my black eoffin let there be strown;

Not a friend, ¹not a friend greet
My poor corpse, where my bones shall be thrown.
A thousand, thousand sighs to save,

Lay me, Ο where

¹ Sad true lover ne’er find my grave

To weep there!
