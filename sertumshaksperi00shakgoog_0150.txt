Now Mrs. Gilp'in (caresul sou] !) ¹

Had two stone bottles found,
To hold the liquor that she loved,

And keep it safe and sound.

Each bottle had a curling eas,
Through which the belt he drew,
And hung a bottle on each side,

To make his balance true.

Then over all, that he might be
Equipp'd from top to t0e‚
His long red cloak, well brush’d and neat,'

He mansully ¹did throw.

Now see him mounted once again
Upon his nimble steed,
Full slowly pacing o'er the stones,

With cantion and good heed.
