Not a drum was heard, nor a funeral note, Ι
As his corpse to the rampart we hurried; Α
Not a soldier discharged his farewell shot

O’er the grave where our hero we buried.

llle buried him darkly at dead of night, ¹
The sods with our bayonets turning,
By the struggling moonbeams' misty light,

And the lantern dimly buming.

No useless colhn enclosed his breast,
Nor in sheet‚ nor in shroud we bound him;

¹ But he lay like a warrior taking his rest,

With his martial eloah around him.

Few and short were the prayers we said,
And we spake not a word of sorrow;-
But we steadiastly looked on the lace of the dead,

And¹we bitterly thought os the morrow.
