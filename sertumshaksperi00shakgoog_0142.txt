COWPER.

John Gilpin was a citizen
Of 'credit and renown,
A trainband captain eke was he

Of famous London town.

John Gilpin's spouse said to her dear,
Though wedded we have been
These twice ten tedious years, yet we

No holiday have seen.

To-morrow is our weddingdcy,

And we will then repair
Unto the Bell at Edmonton,

All in a chaise and pair.

My sister and my sistcr's child,
Myself and children thiec,

ι Will fill the' chaisc; so you must ride

‘On horseback after we.
