Of all the girls that are so smart,
There ’s none like pretty Sally;
She is the darling of my heart,
And she lives in our alley.
There is no lady in the land
Is half so sweet as Sally;
She is the darling of my beart,

And she lives in our alley.

Her father, he makes cabbagehets,
And through the streets‘ does cry 'em;
Her mother, she sells laces long
To such as please to buy 'em ;
But sure such solk's could ne'er beget
So sweet a girl as Sally.

She is the darling of my heart,

Ἰ And she lives in our alley.
